[Jonathan Paulson's answer](https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-explain-dynamic-programming-to-a-4-year-old/answer/Jonathan-Paulson)
```
*writes down "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 =" on a sheet of paper*
"What's that equal to?"
*counting* "Eight!"
*writes down another "1+" on the left*
"What about that?"
*quickly* "Nine!"
"How'd you know it was nine so fast?"
"You just added one more"
"So you didn't need to recount because you remembered there were eight! Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say 'remembering stuff to save time later'"

```

`keywork about Dynamic Programming`
+ We break **a complex problem** == a collection of ***simpler subproblems***
+ Dynamic programming == memoization == "remembering stuff to save time later".
