## Binary search tree
___
##### 1. Binary tree
> Binary tree have at most 2 children (**left** and **right** child). A node don't have child node is called **leaf**
+ Each node contains additional information that called **key** (int, char, struct,...)

##### 2. Binary search tree
It has a few following properties:
+ There must be **no duplicate nodes**.
+ The **left subtree** of a node contains only nodes with keys **lesser** than the node's key.
+ The **right subtree** of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater** than the nodeâ€™s key.
