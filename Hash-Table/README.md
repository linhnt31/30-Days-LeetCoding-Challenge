#### Hash Table
____
- A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs.
- It uses a **hash function** to ***compute an index into an array*** in which an element will be inserted or searched.
- To search a element in a hash table: Time= **O(1)**

Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely ***identify a specific object from a group*** of similar objects. 
Hashing is implemented in 2 steps: 
- **1.** An element is **converted into an integer** by ***using a hash function***. This element can be **used as an index** to store the original element, which falls into the hash table.
- **2.** The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.
