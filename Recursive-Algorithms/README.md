#### Time and Space complexity of Recusive Algorithms
___
The two features of a recursive function that we need to remember:

###### 1. The tree depth 
How many ***total return statements*** will be executed until the base case

###### 2. The tree breadth
How many ***total recursive function calls*** will be made.
+ A recursive function's memory complexity is `O(maximum recursion depth)` - the numbers of functions are stored on **stack**
