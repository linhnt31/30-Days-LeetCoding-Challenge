#### Priority Queue
___
> The C++ priority queue is implemented using a binary heap

Priority queue is a special type of queue
- Each element is associated with a priority 
- If elements with the same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.

Queue is implemented according to **FIFO rule**. Whereas, in a priority queue, the element with the highest priority is used first.

#### Implementation of Priority Queue
___
We can use **an array**, **a linked list**, **a heap** or **a binary search tree**.
But, `heap` provides an efficient implementation of priority queues.
